This repository contains code for predicting customer churn using a neural network-based model. The code, written in Python, employs the Keras library and assumes a CSV dataset named "CustomerChurn_dataset.csv." To get started, install the necessary library with pip install scikeras and execute the code in a Google Colab environment, ensuring Google Drive access.

The code covers exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, optimization, and testing. After training, the optimized model is saved as "best_optimized.model.joblib" in the specified Google Drive directory for potential deployment. Feel free to experiment with hyperparameters based on your dataset and requirements.
